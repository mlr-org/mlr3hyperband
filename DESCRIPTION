Description: Implements hyperband method for hyperparameter
    tuning.  Various termination criteria can be set and combined. The
    class 'AutoTuner' provides a convenient way to perform nested
    resampling in combination with 'mlr3'. The hyperband algorithm was
    proposed by Lisha Li, Kevin Jamieson, Giulia DeSalvo, Afshin
    Rostamizadeh and Ameet Talwalkar (2018) <arXiv:1603.06560>.

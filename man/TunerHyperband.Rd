\description{
Subclass for hyperband tuning.

Hyperband is a budget oriented-procedure, weeding out suboptimally
performing configurations early in a sequential training process,
increasing tuning efficiency as a consequence.

For this, several brackets are constructed with an associated set of configurations
for each bracket. Each bracket as several stages.

Different brackets are initialized with different amounts of configurations
and different budget sizes. To get an idea of how the bracket
layout looks like for a given
argument set, please have a look in the \code{details}.
For more information about the algorithm, please check out the mlr3book. (ADD MISSING REFERENCE)

To identify the budget for evaluating hyperband, the user has to specify
explicitly which hyperparameter of the learner influences the budget
by tagging a single hyperparameter in the \link[paradox:ParamSet]{paradox::ParamSet} with \code{"budget"}.
An alternative approach using subsampling and pipelines is described below.

Naturally, hyperband terminates once all of its brackets are evaluated,
so a \link[mlr3tuning:Terminator]{mlr3tuning::Terminator} in the tuning instance acts as an upper
bound and should be only set to a low value if one is unsure of how long
hyperband will take to finish under the given settings.
}
\details{
This sections explains the calculation of the constants for each bracket.
A small overview will be given here, but for more details please check
out the original paper (see \code{references}).
To keep things uniform with the notation in the paper (and to safe space
in the formulas), \code{R} is used for the upper budget that last remaining configuration should reach.
The formula to calculate the amount of brackets is \code{floor(log(R, eta)) + 1}.
To calculate the starting budget in each bracket, use
\code{R * eta^(-s)}, where \code{s} is the maximum bracket minus the current bracket
index.
For the starting configurations in each bracket it is
\code{ceiling((B/R) * ((eta^s)/(s+1)))}, with \verb{B = (bracket amount) * R}.
To receive a table with the full brackets layout, load the following function
and execute it for the desired \code{R} and \code{eta}.\preformatted{hyperband_brackets = function(R, eta) \{

  result = data.frame()
  smax = floor(log(R, eta))
  B = (smax + 1) * R

  # outer loop - iterate over brackets
  for (s in smax:0) \{

    n = ceiling((B/R) * ((eta^s)/(s+1)))
    r = R * eta^(-s)

    # inner loop - iterate over bracket stages
    for (i in 0:s) \{

      ni = floor(n * eta^(-i))
      ri = r * eta^i
      result = rbind(result, c(smax - s + 1, i + 1, ri, ni))
    \}
  \}

  names(result) = c("bracket", "bracket_stage", "budget", "n_configs")
  return(result)
\}

hyperband_brackets(R = 81L, eta = 3L)

\section{Construction}{
\preformatted{TunerHyperband$new(eta = 2, sampler = NULL)
tnr("hyperband")
}
}

\section{Parameters}{

\itemize{
\item \code{eta} :: \code{numeric(1)}\cr
Fraction parameter of the successive halving algorithm: With every step
the configuration budget is increased by a factor of \code{eta} and only the
best \code{1/eta} configurations are used for the next stage. Non-integer
values are supported, but \code{eta} is not allowed to be less or equal 1.
\item \code{sampler} :: \link[R6:R6Class]{R6::R6Class} object inheriting from \link[paradox:Sampler]{paradox::Sampler}\cr
Object defining how the samples of the parameter space should be drawn
during the initialization of each bracket. The default is uniform sampling.
}
}

\section{Fields}{

\itemize{
\item \code{info} :: \code{\link[data.table:data.table]{data.table::data.table()}}\cr
Table containing information about the intermediate values, matching the
the indices of the original reference instead of the console logs.
It holds the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{bracket} :: \code{integer()}\cr
The console logs about the bracket index are actually not matching
with the original hyperband algorithm, which counts down the brackets
and stops after evaluating bracket 0. The true bracket indices are
given in this column.
\item \code{bracket_stage} :: \code{integer()}\cr
The bracket stage of each bracket. Hyperband starts counting at 0.
\item \code{budget_scaled} :: \code{integer()}\cr
The intermediate budget in each bracket stage calculated by hyperband.
Because hyperband is originally only considered for budgets starting at 1, some
rescaling is done to allow budgets starting at different values.
For this, budgets are internally divided by the lower budget bound to
get a lower budget of 1. Before the learner
receives its budgets for evaluation, the budget is transformed back to
match the original scale again.
\item \code{budget_real} :: \code{integer()}\cr
The real budget values the learner uses for evaluation after hyperband
calculated its scaled budget.
\item \code{n_configs} :: \code{integer()}\cr
The amount of evaluated configurations in each stage. These correspond
to the \code{r_i} in the original paper.
}
}
}

\section{Hyperband without learner budget}{

Thanks to \CRANpkg{mlr3pipelines}, it is possible to use hyperband in combination
with learners lacking a natural budget parameter.
For example, any \link[mlr3:Learner]{mlr3::Learner} can be augmented with a
\link[mlr3pipelines:PipeOp]{PipeOp} operator such as \link[mlr3pipelines:PipeOpSubsample]{PipeOpSubsample}.
With the subsampling rate as budget parameter, the resulting \link[mlr3pipelines:GraphLearner]{GraphLearner}
is fitted on small proportions of the \link[mlr3:Task]{Task} in the first brackets, and on the
complete Task in last brackets.
See examples for some code.
}

\section{Custom sampler}{

Hyperband supports custom \link[paradox:Sampler]{Sampler} object for initial
configurations in each bracket.
A custom sampler may look like this (the full example is given in the
\code{examples} section):\preformatted{# - beta distribution with alpha = 2 and beta = 5
# - categorical distribution with custom probabilities
sampler = SamplerJointIndep$new(list(
  Sampler1DRfun$new(params[[2]], function(n) rbeta(n, 2, 5)),
  Sampler1DCateg$new(params[[3]], prob = c(0.2, 0.3, 0.5))
))
}
}

\section{Runtime scaling w.r.t. the chosen budget}{

The calculation of each bracket currently assumes a linear runtime in the
chosen budget parameter is always given. Hyperband is designed so each
bracket requires approximately the same runtime as the sum of the budget
over all configurations in each bracket is roughly the same. This will not
hold true once the scaling in the budget parameter is not linear
anymore, even though the sum of the budgets in each bracket remains the
same. A basic example can be viewed by calling the function
\code{hyperband_brackets} below with the arguments \code{R = 2} and \code{eta = 2}. If we
run a learner with O(budget^2) time complexity, the runtime of the last
bracket will be 33\% longer than the first bracket
(time of bracket 1 = 2 * 1^2 + 2^2 = 6; time of bracket 2 = 2 * 2^2 = 8).
Of course, this won't break anything, but it should be kept in mind when
applying hyperband. A possible adaption would be to introduce a trafo,
like it is shown in the \code{examples}.
}

\section{Logging}{

When loading the \link{mlr3hyperband} package, two loggers based on the \link{lgr} package are made available.
One is called \code{mlr3}, the other \code{mlr3/mlr3tuning}. The first one is the
original one of \link{mlr3}, while the latter was modified from \link{mlr3tuning}. The modification
is of the form of an added level called \verb{info hb} (value \code{350}), that sits
between \code{warn} and \code{info}. All info logs printed by the hyperband algorithm
receive the level \verb{info hb} and the default threshold for logs is set to
this level.
This means, the \code{info} logs of function/method calls of
\link{mlr3tuning} are not part of the logging by default. To change this,
run\preformatted{# mlr3tuning logs
lg$set_threshold("info")
}

But be careful as this will add a lot of clutter to the logs.
